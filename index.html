<h1> Kevin T. Dunn </h1>
    <p> I am a junior Computer Science student at the University of Connecticut, and am interested in both the fields of cybersecurity & data analytics.  I am currently a full time student and seek to pursue an internship in either these areas or in others as well, as I am passionate about learning about fields in which I have not been exposed to yet. </p>  
<p>Outside of class, I am an  avid reader and a live music & baseball enthusiast.  My goodreads account can be found <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58177316-kevin-dunn">here.</a>, and pictures from concerts & ball games I've attended can be found [here]  </p>
