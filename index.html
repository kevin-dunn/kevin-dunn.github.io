<h1> Kevin T. Dunn </h1>

    <p> I am a junior Computer Science student at the University of Connecticut, concentrating in Computational Data Analytics, with a minor in Food Science. I am currently a fulltime student looking to acquire an internship in the data analytics field or in other areas as well, as I am passionate about learning about fields I may not have been exposed to yet. </p>

    <p>Outside of class, I am an avid reader.  My Goodreads account can be found <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58177316-kevin-dunn">here </a> if you are interested in seeing what I am currently reading & have read in the past. </p>

    <p> I am an ardent believer in fitness & healthy living, and seek to apply my skills in data analytics into searching for a way to improve global health.  Check back for more updates on this endeavor! </p>
