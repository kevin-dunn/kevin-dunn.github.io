<h1> Kevin T. Dunn </h1>
    <p> I am a junior Computer Science student at the University of Connecticut, and am interested in both the fields of cybersecurity & data analytics.  I am currently a full time student and seek to pursue an internship in either these areas or in others as well, as I am passionate about learning about fields in which I have not been exposed to yet. </p>
