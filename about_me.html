    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> I am a junior Computer Science student at the University of Connecticut, concentrating in Computational Data Analytics, with a minor in Food Science. I am currently a fullt\

  n seeing what I am currently reading & have read in the past. </p>

    <p> I am an ardent believer in fitness & healthy living, and seek to apply my skills in data analytics into searching for a way to improve global health.  Check back for more u\
pdates on this endeavor! </p>
